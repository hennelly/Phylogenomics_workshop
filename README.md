# Phylogenomics_workshop

## Ideas for lecture to cover 
- Why is phylogenomics important for conservation? How does it have implications for management?
    - Defining taxonomic and management units
    - Assess role of gene flow in evolutionary history (hybrid speciation or recent gene flow) -> implications on management and protection (ESA)
    - Examples of where phylogenomics matters for conservation
          - Red wolf, other examples? 
- Types of phylogenomic data: UCEs, mitochondria, Y chromosome, reduced representation, whole genome. 
  - What questions and what challenges/limitations each data source presents for phylogenomic inference
- Gene trees vs. species trees
  - phylogenetic discordance - what is it? why is it important to keep in mind? how does it arise?
- Types of ways to infer phylogenies
   - maximum likelihood (ML), bayesian methods, using gene trees (quartet scores in ASTRAL)
- More detail into the methods
   - Alignment, etc
 
- Show an example phylogeny with nodes, bootstrap values
   - Go through exactly what the branch lengths mean, node support means, how node support is inferred, confidence in phylogeny
