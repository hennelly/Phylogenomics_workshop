# Phylogenomic Analysis 2 

** Klaus and Taylor -> Ideas for this? 

1.) Incorporating gene flow + phylogenetic discordance
    - ASTRAL tree -> although I suspect there to be little gene flow/discordance between the Rails. It is nice for teaching about phylogenetic discordance. It is a bit cumbersome 
      with having to divide the genome and then use arrays to infer the each tree. 
    - Twisst -> this is a nice tool to understand what incomplete lineage sorting is, as well as what introgression along the genome looks like. Might not be the most applicable to 
      student's interest and conservation genomics
    - Treemix -> personally not a huge fan, could be spurious results that are difficult to explain, but it is a nice visual analysis to understand gene flow impact on evolutionary relationships

 2.) Or do the mitochondrial tree for Phylogenomics 1, and the nuclear tree for Phylogenomics 2. For people with little experience with phylogenetics, doing the one-locus mtDNA tree first might be helpful, and can include some insightul discussions on comparing mtDNA and the nuclear tree, limitations with mtDNA.
